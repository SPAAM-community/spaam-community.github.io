### Event Description

The field of metagenomics is massively expanding our understanding of biological
environments. While the increasing sensitivity of modern techniques is enabling
the detection of a greater diversity of microbial and eukaryotic taxa at lower
abundance, this data-rich discipline comes with many challenges in making sense
of these highly dimensional datasets. Ancient metagenomics is no exception, but
brings along additional obstacles related to the degraded nature of samples and
low sample biomass. Knowledge sharing, distribution, and coordination between
archaeo- and palaeogeneticists  is crucial to ensure efficiency in overcoming
these challenges.

In this context, we propose a second meeting of the Standards, Precautions and
Advances in Ancient Metagenomics (SPAAM) workshop that [occurred in 2016
(Jena, Germany)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-genom-091416-035526) to
bring together the ancient microbial genetics community to address the issues
raised above. We aim to define the highest priority obstacles in ancient
metagenomics, share past-experiences in overcoming and mitigating these
obstacles, and guide the development of future solutions and standards in this
field. Therefore, PhD and postdoc scholars who are actively analysing these
datasets are our target demographic. In a round-table discussion format, we will
cover four main topics: 

1. Biases in ancient metagenomics research
2. Authentication of ancient metagenomics datasets
3. Open and reproducible science
4. Building networks within the ancient metagenomics community

We envision the primary outcome of this workshop to be the establishment of an
active, ongoing community for consistent knowledge dissemination and
constructive assistance between ancient DNA labs. A major component of this will
be creating structured consensus guidelines for optimizing ancient metagenomics
wet and dry-lab workflows. In doing so, we aim to keep the field focused and
up-to-date in accordance with the advances being made in modern metagenomics
research. Secondarily, we aim to write an opinion paper on the status and major
challenges of the field that clearly defines standards for these types of
studies. ~~A preliminary summary of the workshop will be presented at the
closing ceremony of ISBA9~~. These initiatives should help to consolidate
ancient metagenomics as a solid research field connecting both archaeology and
the biological sciences.

### Accessibility

While we cannot provide financial support, we aim make the workshop as
accessible as possible (babies, children, disabilities etc.). Please let us know
what support you may require in the registration form.
