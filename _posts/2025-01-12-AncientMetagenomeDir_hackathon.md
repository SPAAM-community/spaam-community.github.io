The core team of AncientMetagenomeDir will organise another hackathon to tackle some of AncientMetagenomeDir's open issues and add new features to the database.

Hackathons have helped to accelerate the progress of the AncientMetagenomeDir project in the past and have made it so successful. It is a fun way to work on a larger project with like-minded people collaboratively and to help a project take off. Instead of working all by yourself on an issue, you will have the opportunity to join others and work together in a (virtual) space. This year our main goal will be to kick-start the addition of C14 radiocarbon dates to the database.

While we cannot award any monetary rewards, everyone who contributed will be part of future AncientMetagenomeDir publications, similarly to the two previously published, well-cited publications ([FellowsYates2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-021-00816-y) and [Borry2024](https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.134798.2)).

## When?

07th February 2025 - 9 am to 5 pm CET.

In case there are volunteers from other time zones than Europe, we are happy to accommodate this. So please welcome to join from all across the world.

## Where?

Virtual meeting via GatherTown.

## Who?

Everyone is welcome to join either as AncientMetagenomeDir veteran or as a first-time contributor. We more experienced users will take the time to introduce how anyone can contribute and will be present throughout the day when questions will arise.

## The goals

Although any type of contribution to AncientMetagenomeDir is appreciated, this year's main goals are:

  1. Add C14 radio carbon dates when available to samples
  2. Add new studies to AncientMetagenomeDir
  3. Update the website including the teaching material
  4. Expand the functionality of AMDirT, e.g. to include preparing releases

Please indicate to which goal you would like to contribute to during the hackathon. You can contribute to more than one project of you wish to.
