AncientMetagenomeDir is a community curated resource of lists of all published
shotgun-sequenced ancient metagenome samples. It is primarily meant to act as a
reference guide to help point researchers toward any relevant public data for
comparative analysis. It is hoped it will help researchers track growth and
development of the field of ancient metagenomics over time.

AMDirT is a toolkit for interacting with the AncientMetagenomeDir metadata
repository of ancient metagenomic samples and ancient microbial genomes. This
tool provides ways to validate AncientMetagenomeDir submissions, explore and
download sequencing data for ancient microbial and environmental (meta)genomes,
and automatically prepare input samplesheets for a range of bioinformatic
processing pipelines.

## Ancient Metagenomics Labs

The SPAAM community also curate a list of known labs working in ancient
metagenomics with an aim to help improve collaboration by making labs around
the world more visible.

The list of labs can be found [here](https://spaam-community.github.io/ancient-metagenomics-labs/)

## MINAS MIxS Checklist

<img src="https://www.mixs-minas.org/assets/images/logos/minas-logo-flat.png" alt="MInAS Project logo" width="300px" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width=50%;">

Metadata about samples and data is crucial for the implementation of FAIR
principles. Providing rich metadata also helps researchers to improve the
quality of their work, allowing further insights into their and previously
published data.

An issue for the existing MIxS checklists, is they are designed for modern
sequence data, and are missing critical metadata fields, and/or include fields
that have definitions that do not fit well in an ancient context.

To facilitate improved metadata reporting in paleogenomics, the SPAAM community
are establishing a working group to develop a MIxS extension checklist designed
specifically for ancient metagenomics, as well as collaborating with a working
group in ancient human population genetics to develop a more general checklist
for ancient DNA, provisionally called the 'MInAS' checklist
(Minimum INformation about Ancient Sequences').

The MInAS website can be found [here](https://mixs-minas.org/). Please
join the SPAAM [Slack](/about.md) workspace and [#metadata-standards](https://spaam-community.slack.com/archives/C01BX7EM4EL) channel to join the working group.

## SPAAM Summer Schools

alt="Intro to Ancient Metagenomics SummerSchool Logo" width="200px" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width=50%;">

To help widely disseminate knowledge and expertise in ancient metagenomics,
groups in the SPAAM community offer various training workshops.

These will occur on either on a regular basis or as on-off events, so generally
please keep an eye on the [events](/category/events/) page, as well as the various social
media channels.

We will list regular events here, as well as those that make their training
material availble online for self learning:

- Annually
- Website: [https://spaam-community.github.io/wss-summer-school/](https://spaam-community.github.io/wss-summer-school/)
- Supported by: [Werner Siemens-Stiftung](https://www.wernersiemens-stiftung.ch/), [Hans Knöll Institute](https://leibniz-hki.de/), [MHAAM](https://www.archaeoscience.org/), [MPI-EVA](https://www.eva.mpg.de/), [JSMC](https://www.jsmc-phd.de/)

The SPAAM community hosts a blog that hosts posts from members on a wide-range of ancient metagenomics topics, such as short deep-dive into technical methods, or summarising discussions of questions posted in the slack channel. You can request or post posts on the [#spaam-blog](https://spaam-community.slack.com/archives/C02D3DJP3MY) channel on the [SPAAM slack workspace](/about).

You can see all blog posts [here](https://spaam-community.github.io/category/blog/).

## SPAAMtisch

The community has a monthly online get-together on the SPAAM gather.town space for those who want to discuss some topics of interest chosen by the community, and in an informal and stress-free way! No knowledge or preparation required!

## Introduction to Ancient Metagenomics Textbook

alt="Intro to Ancient Metagenomics Texbook cover" width="200px" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width=50%;">

In addition to providing direct teaching of the summer school, the SPAAM community has decided to also further expand our educational reach by converting the Introduction to Ancient Metagenomics summer school teaching material into a textbook, that can be used by any researcher from around the world to go through the summer school material in their own time.

The draft text book can be found at [http://spaam-community.org/intro-to-ancient-metagenomics-book/](http://www.spaam-community.org/intro-to-ancient-metagenomics-book/)

## Little Book of Smiley Plots Book

<img
src="https://www.spaam-community.org/little-book-of-smiley-plots/assets/images/double-stranded/archibald.png"
alt="Cartoon sketch of a man in a top hat with a large beard and whiskers, with the hairs the shape and coloured in the form of an ancient DNA C to T damage plot" width="200px" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width=50%;">

A key authentication method in ancient DNA is to show the presence of elevated C to T deamination patterns (and the complementary G to A) at the end of DNA molecules - known as damage patterns - originally reported by (Briggs et al. 2007). These patterns can be plotted in what have been colloquially known as ’Smiley Plots. However, there can be a wide range of smiley plots, some which show valid ancient DNA, and others that do not - either due to not actually having true ancient DNA but also from laboratory and/or bioinformatic artifacts.

This book aims to act as a light hearted reference guide to interpreting ancient DNA damage plots, providing a wide range community-submitted example ‘smiley plots’, with descriptions of what the describe and what can cause them. As an added bit of fun, each type of ‘smiley plot’ comes with a artistic interpretation of the line shape contributed by members of the ancient DNA community.
