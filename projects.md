A list of SPAAM commmunity projects

Here we provide a list of projects run by the SPAAM community that to assist in
progressing the field.

## AncientMetagenomeDir

AncientMetagenomeDir is a community curated resource of lists of all published
shotgun-sequenced ancient metagenome samples. It is primarily meant to act as a
reference guide to help point researchers toward any relevant public data for
comparative analysis. It is hoped it will help researchers track growth and
development of the field of ancient metagenomics over time.

- The AncientMetagenomeDir website can be found
  [here](https://spaam-community.github.io/AncientMetagenomeDir/).
- The repository containing sample lists is hosted on github
  [here](https://github.com/SPAAM-community/AncientMetagenomeDir)

## Ancient Metagenomics Labs

The SPAAM community also curate a list of known labs working in ancient
metagenomics with an aim to help improve collaboration by making labs around
the world more visible.

## MINAS MIxS Checklist

Metadata about samples and data is crucial for the implementation of FAIR
principles. Providing rich metadata also helps researchers to improve the
quality of their work, allowing further insights into their and previously
published data.

An issue for the existing MIxS checklists, is they are designed for modern
sequence data, and are missing critical metadata fields, and/or include fields
that have definitions that do not fit well in an ancient context.

To facilitate improved metadata reporting in paleogenomics, the SPAAM community
are establishing a working group to develop a MIxS extension checklist designed
specifically for ancient metagenomics, as well as collaborating with a working
group in ancient human population genetics to develop a more general checklist
for ancient DNA, provisionally called the 'MInAS' checklist
(Minimum INformation about Ancient Sequences').

The MInAS website can be found [here](https://minas.paleogenomics.eu/). Please
join the SPAAM [Slack](/about.md) channel to join the working group.

## SPAAM Summer Schools

To help widely disseminate knowledge and expertise in ancient metagenomics,
groups in the SPAAM community offer various training workshops.

These will occur on either on a regular basis or as on-off events, so generally
please keep an eye on the [events](/category/events/) page, as well as the various social
media channels.

We will list regular events here, as well as those that make their training
material availble online for self learning:
