Hello all!

We, the Steering Committee of the SPAAM community would like to take a moment to introduce ourselves and give you all a quick idea of what we do.

First, what is the Steering Committee? This is a new organizing committee that was formed last year during the [**SPAAM4**](https://spaam-community.github.io/events/2022/10/12/event-spaam4/) conference. It is intended to guide the SPAAM community in a more formalized way; this involves brainstorming and proposing new initiatives and helping new initiatives get off the ground (like the successfully  launched [**SPAAMtisch**](https://spaam-community.github.io/projects/#spaamtisch)), increasing engagement and support for SPAAM members and events, helping with ongoing organization efforts, publicization of SPAAM, and sourcing funds for the maintenance of SPAAM.

We all are volunteers on the Steering Committee and we are really excited to work with all of you and help improve the SPAAM community.

The Steering Committee

Miriam Bravo-Lopez (she/her) - Chair

I am a Mexican postdoctoral researcher at the International Laboratory for Human Genome Research (LIIGH), UNAM. My passion lies in exploring the evolutionary journey of ancient human pathogens using paleogenomics and paleoproteomics. I find solace hanging out with dogs, and when it comes to activities, running is my top pick.

Betsy (Elizabeth Nelson) (she/her) - Treasurer

I am a postdoc at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, France, and a faculty member of the Summer internship for INdigenous peoples in Genomics (SING) Canada. My research examines the emergence, evolution, and spread of infectious diseases in contexts marked by climatic, cultural, environmental, and socio-political transitions. I’m slightly obsessed with Logan Bean, dog-extraordinaire; But I also love making ceramics, gardening, hiking, and fishing.
